Maintaining the Integrity of Structural and Fire Protection Systems and Building Documentation in Historic Buildings: Washburn Shops Case Study	MQP.	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118/		http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118/unrestricted/Maintaining_the_Integrity_of_Structural_and_Fire_Protection_Systems_and_Building_Documentation_in_Historic_Buildings_MQP.pdf	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118/unrestricted/Maintaining_the_Integrity_of_Structural_and_Fire_Protection_Systems_and_Building_Documentation_in_Historic_Buildings_MQP.pdf	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118/unrestricted/Maintaining_the_Integrity_of_Structural_and_Fire_Protection_Systems_and_Building_Documentation_in_Historic_Buildings_MQP.pdf		" As buildings age, facilities management becomes an issue for institutions like Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Throughout a building's lifecycle, drawings become inaccurate, code compliance becomes dated, and safety hazards emerge. This project developed a framework to investigate and update structural and fire protection systems to ensure code compliance and to generate a comprehensive Building Information Model for functional documentation. Washburn Shops, built as one of the first buildings at WPI in 1867, provides a case study for this facilities management framework."	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118/unrestricted/Maintaining_the_Integrity_of_Structural_and_Fire_Protection_Systems_and_Building_Documentation_in_Historic_Buildings_MQP.pdf		http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031212-134118//unrestricted/Maintaining_the_Integrity_of_Structural_and_Fire_Protection_Systems_and_Building_Documentation_in_Historic_Buildings_MQP.pdf	"Marokhovsky, Alexandra Helene; Bowden, Amanda Judith; Hanson, Paige Allen"	 Guillermo F.

"""A touch of women's tenderness"" -- Dickens's use of Shakespeare's Othello and Nancy's Narrative of Redemption in Oliver Twist."

I argue that Dickens's Nancy is a common woman's Desdemona, and through her the reader experiences a compelling narrative of redemption, making her more tragic than the idealized Desdemona. Nancy's realism as a London prostitute and her awareness of her own doom create a modern rendition of Shakespeare's classic drama."				"Wojtkun, Lauren Elizabeth"	" Michelle Ephraim, Joel Brattin."

" This report prepared for the International Secretariat (I.S.) of Amnesty International (A.I.) is an assessment of the London based office's communication, work culture and environment. Analysis of the organization was done with interviews, surveys and focus groups to determine communication gaps, and other problems the I.S. faces. The International Secretariat was discovered to have difficulties in communication flow, working environment and structural organization. The provided recommendations will improve the staff morale and overall communications of the organization."				"Therrien, Jaclyn Ann; Peterson, Todd F.; Collette, Kristin A.; Anderson, Erica M."

" This report, prepared for the Royal Armouries Education Staff, evaluates the educational quality of their ""Hands on History"" exhibit and its appeal to various groups. This was achieved through surveys and observation of visitors and interviews with Tower staff. Results show that hands-on methods are more effective at keeping visitors at an exhibit for extended period[s]; hands-on exhibits should be incorporated into future exhibition designs."

" The Museum of Homelessness (MoH) is driven by a core principle of giving a voice to the people who have been silenced throughout history, especially with regards to the homeless community. The goal of this project was to assist the museum in the creation of educational resources to help schools fulfill a part of the Citizenship Curriculum, primarily Key Stages 3 and 4. Through extensive research, interviews, workshops, and a review of curricular materials on homelessness, the team developed a set of deliverables that included new web pages, a school database, a good practice guide and a set of lesson plans. Educating students about homelessness is one way to increase awareness about homelessness and instill the ideas of acceptance and tolerance in generations to come."	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/MoH_Final_Report.pdf		http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/MoH_Final_Report.pdf	"Xie, Yanxi; Pereira, Marissa Corinne; Hudak, Tess Elian; Benn, Geraldine Anne"	 Jennifer deWinter; Dominic Golding.		2017-06-22	Social and Human Services	Unrestricted			http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/MoH_Final_Report.pdf; http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/MoH-Final-Presentation.pdf; http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/Catalogue_of_MoH_Collection.pdf; http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/Good_Practice_Guide_Framework.pdf; http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/Lessons_and_Supplemental_Materials.pdf; http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-062217-133116/unrestricted/MoH_Database_of_Schools.pdf

Similar discussions of key topics -- including racial equality before God, the injustice of colonization, Christian hypocrisy, and the introduction of alcohol by whites -- highlight shared ideological foundations and mutual dedication to the cause of survivance. The disparity between their public approaches derives not from fundamental disagreements in outlook, but instead from the differing demands of vastly dissimilar national and regional contexts. Although he initially appears conciliatory and assimilated, Jones was driven by the same ethos that guided his Pequot counterpart."	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-043014-184126/unrestricted/Boudreau_White_Savages_MQP.pdf		http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-043014-184126//unrestricted/Boudreau_White_Savages_MQP.pdf	"Boudreau, Daniel Ronald"	 James Cocola.		2014-04-30		Unrestricted			No
